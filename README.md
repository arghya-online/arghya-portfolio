# arghya-portfolio
My portfolio website made with React.js.


Hey, I’m Arghya. I’m a developer based in Kolkata. I spend most of my time building websites and applications that actually help in some way. I love when something I build ends up helping someone or solving a real problem.

Programming, for me, is half logic and half patience. It’s not always fun — sometimes it’s just me staring at the screen, fixing one tiny thing at a time. But the moment it finally works, it’s a proper Eureka feeling.

When I’m not working, I like to build and tinker with robots. So far, I’ve built 8+ bots, won 2+ hackathons, and shipped a few gigs along the way.

And yeah, maybe one day I’ll finally be able to explain to my parents what all this “coding stuff” actually is.
